# Example Notebooks

Examples demonstrating usage of TFF methods.


In order to start the examples on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), please follow the link "Run in Google Colab" provided with the examples. To run the code without
issues, connect to a GPU runtime (Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Choose
GPU in Hardware accelerator section).

[AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/) instance
was used to create the precomputed results (VM with 8 vCPUs and TESLA v100 GPU).
