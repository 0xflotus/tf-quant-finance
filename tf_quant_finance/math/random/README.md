# Ops related to pseudo-random and quasi-random number generation.

This directory contains ops to efficiently generate random numbers and
quasi-random sequences.

For the random numbers, [TensorFlow](tensorflow.org) and
[TensorFlow Probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)
already contain significant support. The ops in this module are meant to
complement and extend those ops where deemed necessary.
